	<h2> Domain-Independent Duplicate Detection </h1>

	<h3> Description </h3>
	<p>
		The Domain-Independent Duplicate Detection step allows the user to compute groups of records that represent the same real-world entity. <br>
		The records that make up a group don't have to be exact matches between each other. The user can specify how similar the records must be to be included in the same group.
	</p>

	<p>
		The user does not need specific knowledge regarding the dataset, since the fields of each record and concatenated into a single field to compute similarity.
	</p>

	<p>
		The step outputs two columns: The first column corresponds to the grouping of records. Each group contains the records that correspond to one real-world entity. The group identifier is the index of the first record of the group. The second column corresponds to the similarity between a record and the first element of its group. When a record is the first one of its group, the similarity value is null.
	</p>

	<h3> Options </h3>
	<p> 
		The following table describes the options associated with the Domain-Independent Duplicate Detection step
	</p>
	<table border="1">
		<tr>
			<th> <b>Option</b> </th>
			<th> <b>Description</b> </th>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td> Step Name </td>
			<td> The name of this step as it appears in the transformation workspace. This name must be unique within the transformation. </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td> Matching Threshold </td>
			<td> A value between 0 and 1 that corresponds to the minimum value of similarity that must exist between two records for them to be considered approximate duplicates, where 0 corresponds to the records being completely different and 1 corresponds to the records being exactly alike. </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td> Grouping Column Name </td>
			<td> The name of the output column that contains the group to which each the record belongs to.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td> Similarity Column Name </td>
			<td> The name of the output column that contains the similarity between the first record of the group and the record in the row. </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td> Remove Non-Duplicates </td>
			<td> By selecting this option, the records that do not match any other records are removed from the step's output. </td>
		</tr>
